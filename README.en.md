## Back-end Developer

Hello! I'm currently a Software Development student (ADS) at the Instituto Federal Sul-rio-grandense (IFSul). I'm currently focusing on data structures and frameworks such as Spring Boot and the broader Spring ecosystem. I also have a solid foundation in programming logic and worked as a teaching assistant for Java Algorithms at my institution.  

I interned for one semester in the ERP systems field, where I had the opportunity to work with COBOL/Java and gain experience with agile methodologies. I'm now looking for an internship where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a professional, delivering valuable solutions to the team and company.
